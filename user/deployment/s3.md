Travis CI can automatically upload your build to S3 after a successful build.

For a minimal configuration, all you need to do is add the following to your `.travis.yml`:

    deploy:
      provider: s3
      access_key_id: "YOUR AWS ACCESS KEY"
      secret_access_key: "YOUR AWS SECRET KEY"
      bucket: "S3 Bucket"

This example is almost certainly not ideal, as you probably want to upload your built binaries and documentation. Set skip_cleanup to true to prevent Travis CI from deleting your build artifacts.

    deploy:
      provider: s3
      access_key_id: "YOUR AWS ACCESS KEY"
      secret_access_key: "YOUR AWS SECRET KEY"
      bucket: "S3 Bucket"
      skip_cleanup: true

You can find your AWS Access Keys [here](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home?#security_credential). It is recommended to encrypt that key.
Assuming you have the Travis CI command line client installed, you can do it like this:

    travis encrypt --add deploy.secret_access_key

You will be prompted to enter your api key on the command line.

You can also have the `travis` tool set up everything for you:

    $ travis setup s3

Keep in mind that the above command has to run in your project directory, so it can modify the `.travis.yml` for you.

### S3 bucket regions

By default the region `us-east-1` is used when deploying to S3. If your bucket is hosted in a different region, deploying using the default region results in the following error.

    The bucket you are attempting to access must be addressed using the specified endpoint.
    Please send all future requests to this endpoint. (AWS::S3::Errors::PermanentRedirect)

This can be resolved by specifying your bucket's region using the `region` configuration. For example, this example uses the `eu-west-1` region.

    deploy:
      provider: s3
      access_key_id: "YOUR AWS ACCESS KEY"
      secret_access_key: "YOUR AWS SECRET KEY"
      bucket: "S3 Bucket"
      skip_cleanup: true
      region: eu-west-1

### S3 bucket endpoints

By default the endpoint `s3.amazonaws.com` is used when deploying to S3. This endpoint automatically routes to the North Virginia and the Pacific Northwest regions. You can set the endpoint by using the `endpoint` option. This example uses the Tokyo endpoint (s3-ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com) to deploy to S3.

    deploy:
      provider: s3
      access_key_id: "YOUR AWS ACCESS KEY"
      secret_access_key: "YOUR AWS SECRET KEY"
      bucket: "S3 Bucket"
      skip_cleanup: true
      endpoint: s3-ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com

### Deploy On Tags

Often, you want to deploy only when you release a new version of your code.

You can tell Travis CI only to deploy on tags, like this:

    deploy:
      provider: s3
      access_key_id: "YOUR AWS ACCESS KEY"
      secret_access_key: "YOUR AWS SECRET KEY"
      bucket: "S3 Bucket"
      skip_cleanup: true
      on:
        tags: true

### Deploy From Only One Folder

Often, you don't want to upload your entire project to S3. You can tell Travis CI to only upload a single folder to S3. You can use the `local-dir` option to do so. This example uploads the `build` directory of your project to S3:
	
    deploy:
      provider: s3
      access_key_id: "YOUR AWS ACCESS KEY"
      secret_access_key: "YOUR AWS SECRET KEY"
      bucket: "S3 Bucket"
      skip_cleanup: true
      local-dir: build

### Deploy to a Specific S3 Folder

Often, you want to upload only to a specific S3 Folder. You can use the `upload-dir` option to set the S3 destination folder. This example uploads to the `travis-builds` folder of your s3 bucket.

    deploy:
      provider: s3
      access_key_id: "YOUR AWS ACCESS KEY"
      secret_access_key: "YOUR AWS SECRET KEY"
      bucket: "S3 Bucket"
      skip_cleanup: true
      upload-dir: travis-builds


### Deploy to a S3 hosted website:

Deploying to a amazon S3 website can be a little tricky. First, you need to set a special endpoint based on your region:

| Region                               | Endpoint                                            |
|--------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| US Standard	                       | bucket-name.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com      |
| US West (Oregon) Region              | bucket-name.s3-website-us-west-2.amazonaws.com      |
| US West (Northern California) Region | bucket-name.s3-website-us-west-1.amazonaws.com      |
| EU (Ireland) Region 	               | bucket-name.s3-website-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com      |
| Asia Pacific (Singapore) Region	   | bucket-name.s3-website-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com |
| Asia Pacific (Sydney) Region	       | bucket-name.s3-website-ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com |
| Asia Pacific (Tokyo) Region	       | bucket-name.s3-website-ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com |
| South America (Sao Paulo) Region	   | bucket-name.s3-website-sa-east-1.amazonaws.com      |

After looking up your endpoint, you should be able to use this template to upload to your website.

    deploy:
      provider: s3
      access_key_id: "YOUR AWS ACCESS KEY"
      secret_access_key: "YOUR AWS SECRET KEY"
      bucket: "S3 Bucket"
      skip_cleanup: true
      endpoint: "Bucket endpoint (found above)"
      regoin: "Bucket region"

Remember that you need to set the bucket to have an ACL of `public` for anybody to be able to see your website.

### Deploy to Multiple Buckets:

If you want to upload to multiple buckets, you can do this:

    deploy:
      - provider: s3
        access_key_id: "YOUR AWS ACCESS KEY"
        secret_access_key: "YOUR AWS SECRET KEY"
        bucket: "S3 Bucket"
        skip_cleanup: true
      - provider: s3
        access_key_id: "YOUR AWS ACCESS KEY"
        secret_access_key: "YOUR AWS SECRET KEY"
        bucket: "Second S3 Bucket"
        skip_cleanup: true

### Branch to release from

You can explicitly specify the branch to release from with the **on** option:

    deploy:
      provider: s3
      access_key_id: "YOUR AWS ACCESS KEY"
      secret_access_key: "YOUR AWS SECRET KEY"
      bucket: "S3 Bucket"
      on:
        branch: production

Alternatively, you can also configure Travis CI to release from all branches:

    deploy:
      provider: s3
      access_key_id: "YOUR AWS ACCESS KEY"
      secret_access_key: "YOUR AWS SECRET KEY"
      bucket: "S3 Bucket"
      on:
        all_branches: true

Builds triggered from Pull Requests will never trigger a release.

### Conditional releases

It is possible to make releases conditional using the **on** option:

    deploy:
      provider: s3
      access_key_id: "YOUR AWS ACCESS KEY"
      secret_access_key: "YOUR AWS SECRET KEY"
      bucket: "S3 Bucket"
      on:
        branch: staging
        node: 0.10

The above configuration will trigger a release if the staging branch is passing on NodeJS 0.10.

or

    deploy:
      provider: s3
      access_key_id: "YOUR AWS ACCESS KEY"
      secret_access_key: "YOUR AWS SECRET KEY"
      bucket: "S3 Bucket"
      on:
        branch: staging
        rvm: 2.0.0

The above configuration will trigger a release if the staging branch is passing on Ruby 2.0.0.

You can also add custom conditions:

    deploy:
      provider: s3
      access_key_id: "YOUR AWS ACCESS KEY"
      secret_access_key: "YOUR AWS SECRET KEY"
      bucket: "S3 Bucket"
      on:
        condition: "$cc = gcc"

The available conditions are:

* **all_branches** - when set to true, trigger release from any branch if passing
* **branch** - branch or list of branches to release from if passing
* **tags** - when set to true, Travis CI only deploys on tagged builds
* **condition** - custom condition or list of custom conditions
* **jdk** - jdk version to release from if passing
* **node** - nodejs version to release from if passing
* **perl** - perl version to release from if passing
* **php** - php version to release from if passing
* **python** - python version to release from if passing
* **ruby** - ruby version to release from if passing
* **repo** - only trigger a build for the given repository, to play nice with forks

### Running commands before and after release

Sometimes you want to run commands before or after releasing a gem. You can use the `before_deploy` and `after_deploy` stages for this. These will only be triggered if Travis CI is actually pushing a release.

    before_deploy: "echo 'ready?'"
    deploy:
      ..
    after_deploy:
      - ./after_deploy_1.sh
      - ./after_deploy_2.sh
